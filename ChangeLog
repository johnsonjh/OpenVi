OpenVi 7.5.28 -> OpenVi 7.5.29-dev: Tue May 21 02:11:09 2024
        + Add a new output level, M_XINFO, which outputs an informational
          message and ignores the state of the verbose and silent flags
        + Show version command output even in ex silent mode
        + Update the usage help text to document the new `-C` option
        + Minor changes to xinstall.c to appease Oracle Lint warnings
        + Consistently use .Dq for double-quoting in man pages
        + Fix various spelling errors and typos, mostly in comments
        + Increase buf size

OpenVi 7.4.27 -> OpenVi 7.5.28: Sun Apr 7 19:06:02 2024
        + Add `-C cmd` startup option; similar to `-c` but always runs `cmd`
        + Remove duplicate include statements from xinstall.c
        + Add showfilename set option to display file name; OK millert@ otto@
        + Avoid use after free of frp and frp->tname; found by smatch,
          ok miod@ millert@
        + fix fd leaks in error paths; ok miod@

OpenVi 7.4.26 -> OpenVi 7.4.27: Wed Nov 22 19:30:41 2023
        + Update README file with additional links and packaging information
        + Always suppress db_err output when !lno; closes GitHub Issue #34
        + Update minpwcache.c to OpenBSD pwcache.c v1.16; contains spelling
          fixes from Paul Tagliamonte; only comments, no user-facing change
        + Use openbsd_strlcpy for strlcpy in ptym_open(); fixes compilation
          on AIX and some other System V-derived systems

OpenVi 7.4.25 -> OpenVi 7.4.26: Fri Oct 28 00:15:39 2023
        + Add a fallback path for `altnotation` mode; fixes a crash on macOS
        + Bump MAX_CHARACTER_COLUMNS to 6 for future usage
        + Eliminate strcpy usage in ptym_open function

OpenVi 7.4.24 -> OpenVi 7.4.25: Fri Oct 27 11:44:45 2023
        + Add a new option, `altnotation` (abbreviation `an`), inspired
          by the Nvi2 2.2.1 option of the same name; if set, most control
          characters less than 0x20 will be displayed in <C-char> notation,
          and carriage feed, escape, and delete will be displayed as <Ret>,
          <Esc>, and <Del>, respectively

OpenVi 7.4.23 -> OpenVi 7.4.24: Tue Oct 10 19:47:07 2023
        + Silence a warning when building with recent Clang compilers
        + Treat consecutive paragraph indicators as different paragraphs;
          Consecutive empty lines count toward the same state, so there're
          2x states (to get in and out). `^L` and `.PP` are counted as text,
          hitting those in the text should be treated as getting out of a
          paragraph and then getting in. From Walter Alejandro Iglesias and
          Zhihao Yuan in nvi2; ok bluhm@
        + Fix typo in last ChangeLog entry

OpenVi 7.3.22 -> OpenVi 7.4.23: Sat Jun 24 03:12:41 2023

        + Remove vestigial `?` case from `xinstall` top-level `getopt` loop;
          Prompted by dlg@, help from dlg@, millert@; ok naddy@ millert@ dlg@
        + Packaging improvements from @jswank to honor DESTDIR to support
          relocatable installation, use relative symlinks for `view` and `ex`
          programs, and not create `/var/tmp/vi.recover` during installation

OpenVi 7.2.21 -> OpenVi 7.3.22: Tue Apr 11 07:54:09 2023
        + OpenBSD 7.3 released; bumping OpenBSD major version part to 7.3
        + Bump OpenBSD date synchronization version part to 01/29/2023
        + Autoprint line number to match the confirmation line;
          patch from `nvi2` via millert@
        + Fix crash when tags file pattern has a trailing `\`, patch
          via `nvi2`; co-authored by Craig Leres <leres@FreeBSD.org>

OpenVi 7.2.20 -> OpenVi 7.2.21: Tue Jan 31 03:26:07 2023
        + Fix handling of ex_range escaped backslashes; If there are two
          consecutive backslashes, skip past both so the second is not
          mistakenly treated as an escape character. This is consistent
          with how escaped backslashes are treated in ex_substitute()
          and global(); from Bosco G. G.
        + Spelling fixes from Paul Tagliamonte
        + Fix ^^D and 0^D description in man page; pointed out by
          Tomas Rippl; ok jmc@
        + Fix typo in `.gitattributes`; no code changes

OpenVi 7.2.19 -> OpenVi 7.2.20: Sun Jan 1 05:36:31 2023
        + Correctly increment version identifier to match release
        + Normalize comment blocks; no functional changes

OpenVi 7.1.18 -> OpenVi 7.2.19: Tue Nov 29 22:04:43 2022
        + Add translation of README.md into Brazilian Portuguese
        + Suppress the "UNLOCKED" message on AIX
        + Set OBJECT_MODE when stripping compiled binaries
        + Add DEP5 metadata file to the source tree
        + Add SPDX license identifiers for REUSE compliance
        + OpenBSD 7.2 enters beta; bumping OpenBSD version to 7.2

OpenVi 7.1.17 -> OpenVi 7.1.18: Sat Jul 23 19:40:59 2022
        + Quiet complaints when recovery directory is non-existent
        + Improve various status messages
        + Add permission statements to `GNUmakefile`, `BSDmakefile`
        + Update documentation

OpenVi 7.0.16 -> OpenVi 7.1.17: Sun Apr 24 07:57:29 2022
        + In v_event_get check qp->output for NULL before passing to
          e_memcmp(); other users of qp->output already include a NULL check;
          avoids a crash when cursor key support is disabled in cl/cl_term.c;
          from Jeremy Mates; ok tb@
        + Check tkp->output != NULL before taking strlen for both command
          mappings and input mappings; this adds a missing check for command
          mappings and simplifies the input mappings; ok millert@
        + From upstream man page, add missing comma; ok jmc@
        + Update documentation

OpenVi 7.0.15 -> OpenVi 7.1.16: Sun Mar 13 22:10:37 2022
        + Document that PCC (Portable C Compiler) is working
        + Add a BSD make wrapper that calls gmake if available
        + Add OpenBSD basename functionality for use with xinstall
        + Simplify compatibility headers
        + Make `sstrip` target depend on the `strip` target, since many
          platforms do not support all the sstrip options, so still stripping
          as much as is possible is the most user-friendly thing to try
        + Add support for Solaris; tested on Oracle Solaris 11.4.0 with GCC,
          Clang (V6+), and the Oracle Developer Studio V12.6 compiler
        + Add support for illumos; tested on OpenIndiana Hipster 2022.03
        + Add support for NetBSD; tested on NetBSD/amd64 9.2-stable with
          the system provided GCC and Clang from binary packages; compiling
          `CC=clang LTO=1` requires the LLVM LLD linker `ld.lld` installed
        + Add support for IBM AIX 7+; tested on IBM AIX 7.2 and IBM AIX 7.3
          with GNU GCC (8, 9, 10, 11), IBM XL C/C++ V16.1+ (gxlc, xlclang),
          and IBM Open XL C/C++ V17.1+ using ncurses from IBM's AIX Toolbox;
          AIX builds default to 64-bit (on 64-bit systems) when using a
          supported compiler; the environment variable `MAIXBITS` can be set
          to `32` or `64` to force compilation of a 32-bit or 64-bit binary
        + Various portability improvements (portable BSD getopt, warn, etc.)
        + Reorganize source tree to better separate logical components
        + `WCOREDUMP` is not in POSIX.1-2008, so don't require it to build
        + Similarly, check if `TIOCSCTTY` is available and don't require it
        + Add `xinstall`, a BSD install utility based on OpenBSD `install(1)`
        + Switch `vfork` to `fork` as `vfork` is now gone from POSIX.1-2008
        + Clear pointer after ending screen for safety
        + `README.md`, documentation, and man page corrections and improvements
        + Apply `expandtab` to lines filtered with the `!` command, via `nvi2`
        + OpenBSD 7.1 enters beta; bumping OpenBSD version to 7.1
        + Modify text `%s/OpenBSD vi/OpenVi/` in `common/recover.c`
        + Provide a more helpful message when ex-mode has background screens
        + Fully redraw screen on refresh with ^L / ^R
        + Make `taglength` work correctly; fix from nvi 1.8x
        + Make `join` work as specified in the POSIX standard; nvi 1.8x
        + Fix problem with autoindenting and ^^D input; patch from nvi 1.8x
        + Fix to reset screen offset of top line exceeding number of screens
          adapted from Sven Verdoolaege's nvi 1.8x patch
        + Fix tty from ex-mode on `q` when there are multiple screens; patch
          from Al Viro via nvi 1.8x; also minor redraw adjustments
        + Use `-Wall` by default for all builds; drop `-Wextra` for release
        + Switch default optimization level to `-Os` for release builds; use
          `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` for non-debugging builds by default as well
        + Do not warn about `ttyname` or `ioctl` failures for `stderr` unless
          `stderr` is a tty according to `isatty()`
        + Fix out of bounds access in file completion
        + Raise the maximum ex-script mmap size limit
        + `DEBUG=1` now defaults to `-O0` rather than `-Og`
        + Avoid undefined behavior in `vs_crel()` and `ex_is_abbrev()`
        + Suppress more warnings and potential warnings

OpenVi 7.0.12 -> OpenVi 7.0.15: Thu Feb 24 12:18:33 2022
        + Avoid O_PATH clash in source proper (rather than in awk script)
        + Remove deprecated interpreter internals documentation
        + Actually use `pledge()` for SerenityOS and OpenBSD 5.9 or later
        + Add `superstrip` (aka `sstrip`) `GNUmakefile` target to
          aggressively strip the compiled binary using `sstrip` if available
        + Add `upx` `GNUmakefile` target to compress the compiled binary
          using `upx` if available
        + Cosmetic clean-up of `GNUmakefile` and normalize to 79-columns
        + MSYS2 is also supported, tested with MSYS2 on Windows 11 (x86_64)
        + Add support for Cygwin, tested with Cygwin64 on Windows 11 (x86_64)
        + Update `README.md` to document usage for `LIBS` variable, correct
          `OPTFLAGS` to `OPTLEVEL`, expand external links and information,
          add citations regarding past multibyte efforts, use fancy quotes,
          and correctly state that the traditional `ex` / `vi` was part of
          the *first* Berkeley Software Distribution, mention OpenBSD's
          standard secure coding practices, safe(r) functions, and ISC license
        + Respect `LIBS` to set/override the default libraries for linking
        + Make failure to strip non-fatal; fixes `install-strip` and `strip`
          in the case where `./bin/vi` is un-strippable (i.e. `bin/vi` is
          `upx` compressed or missing section headers from `sstrip`ing)
        + Fixes for `vi` recovery mode. From `trondd@`, tested by various,
          ok `afresh1@`; this advances OpenBSD release date to 02/20/2022
        + Update `.gitignore` to add `compile_commands.json`
        + Suppress a few possible warnings
        + Since HiDPI screens are more common, allow terminal dimensions of
          3640x2048; this might need to be further extended for 4K displays

OpenVi 7.0.11 -> OpenVi 7.0.12: Sun Feb 20 12:57:42 2022
        + Update `README.md` with some background info and rationale
        + Always use internal reallocarray; closes GitHub Issue #5

OpenVi 7.0.10 -> OpenVi 7.0.11: Sat Feb 12 19:42:28 2022
        + Silence a few more warnings; adjust default debugging `CFLAGS`
        + Add an initial regex man page (which is not yet installed),
          `docs/USD.doc/re_format/vi_regex.7`
        + Update `LICENSE.md`; fix email address for `millert@`
        + Simplify `db/sys/issetugid.c` ifdef's
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* cclass.h to `1.7` (2020/12/30 08:54:42)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* cname.h to `1.6` (2020/12/30 08:53:30)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* engine.c to `1.26` (2020/12/28 21:41:55)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* regerror.c to `1.15` (2020/12/30 08:56:38)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* regex2.h to `1.12` (2021/01/03 17:07:58)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* regexec.c to `1.14` (2018/07/11 12:38:46)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* regcomp.c to `1.43` (2021/01/03 17:07:57)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* strlcpy to `1.16` (2019/01/25 00:19:25)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* reallocarray to `1.3` (2015/09/13 08:31:47)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* getopt_long to `1.32` (2020/05/27 22:25:09)
        + Update bundled *OpenBSD* basename to `1.17` (2020/10/20 19:30:14)
        + Add initial *Midipix* support

OpenVi 7.0.9 -> OpenVi 7.0.10: Wed Feb 9 16:36:25 2022
        + Silence some warnings and general style clean-up
        + Clarify text of some visual mode messages; use the POSIX thousands
          numeric separator for displaying most line and character counts
        + Use `/var/tmp` for the `vi.recover` directory; on most Linux
          systems, this persists across reboots and gives a higher chance
          of recovery than `/tmp` which is often a memory-backed filesystem
        + New feature: If `ruler` is set, print a percentage after position
        + New feature: If `windowname` is set, always show the file name
        + New feature: If `bserase` (abbrev `bse`) is set, then any newly
          backspaced characters are immediately erased from the screen
        + Handle `SIGQUIT` like `SIGINT`, which prevents `^\` (Control-\)
          from causing ex-mode to abort and drop core; aligns closer to
          Vim's behavior in ex-mode - which uses non-canonical input mode,
          so `^\` doesn't cause a stop. The rationale for this change is
          because we're using `^\` as a shortcut to enter our ex-mode (which
          for `nex` uses standard canonical line-based input), if `SIGQUIT`
          is unhandled, it's easy to abort by accident by sending more than
          one `^\` in succession, which can happen on lagged connection
        + Fix a long-standing bug where using `^G` on an empty file would
          include a random garbage byte in the displayed output
        + Reword "Already in the first column" to "Already at the first
          column" to be consistent with the other movement error messages
        + Remove documentation files not explicitly under the 3-BSD license
        + Update header comment of all modified files
        + Reformat the ChangeLog to break lines at 76 columns
        + Convert tabs to spaces and adjust source indentation with `cppi`
        + Update docs; Markdown-ify `LICENSE` and rename to `LICENSE.md`

OpenVi 7.0.8 -> OpenVi 7.0.9: Mon Jan 31 21:43:08 2022
        + Add a missing include to fix compilation on Void with musl libc
        + Update `README.md`

OpenVi 7.0.7 -> OpenVi 7.0.8: Mon Jan 31 10:12:53 2022
        + Rework `README.md`
        + Drop `-pipe` and `-fomit-frame-pointer` for wider compatibility
        + Add support for building on macOS; tested on 12.1/x86_64/21C5021h
        + Add support for building on OpenBSD; tested on 7.0-current/ARM64
        + Normalize licensing, acknowledgements, and copyright statements
        + Normalize macros and conditional if/ifdef/ifndef's with `cppi`
        + Add support for building on FreeBSD; tested on 13.0-REL-p6/ARM64
        + Minor code clean-up
        + Drop memmove wrapper (for old systems with bcopy but no memmove)
        + Add support for building with musl libc
        + Add `imctrl` and `imkey` options, inspired by `cannactrl` and
          `fepkey` options in `nvi-m17n` by itojun. If `imctrl` option is
          set, the input method is controlled by using escape sequences
          compatible with Tera Term and RLogin. The state of the input
          method in commands specified by imkey option is saved and restored
          automatically. This input method is deactivated upon returning to
          command mode; this implementation taken from NetBSD-current's
          `contrib/nvi`
        + Improve `make` output and use more logical compilation order
        + Add `virecover.8` man page adapted from NetBSD
        + Add a missing break in `common/log.c`
        + Avoid undefined behavior in `*BIT` macros; patch from NetBSD; also
          apply patch from NetBSD for PR bin/52716
        + Update `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`

        + Important fix to `GNUmakefile` for linking with Clang's `lld`
        + Remove installed man pages as part of the `uninstall` target
        + Workaround to accommodate `make clean all -j N' where `N` > 1
        + Clean-up whitespace and line lengths of sources and `GNUmakefile`

OpenVi 7.0.5 -> OpenVi 7.0.6: Thu Jan 27 16:45:12 2022
        + Important fix for back-end database file locking; also, switch
          back to using the system libc-provided mkstemp functions to elide
          some issues that would otherwise occur on networked filesystems
        + Add proper attribution for DragonflyBSD Project to `LICENSE` text
        + Correct `GNUmakefile` messages for the `make install` target
        + Clean-up excess and trailing whitespace in source files

OpenVi 7.0.4 -> OpenVi 7.0.5: Thu Jan 27 11:00:46 2022
        + No verbose build by default; set variables V (or DEBUG) to enable
        + No LTO and LGC by default; set variables LTO and/or LGC to enable
        + Don't attempt linking with libjemalloc or libmtmalloc by default
        + Clean-up headers to speed compilation time & decrease binary size
        + Import and adapt OpenBSD Berkeley DB from OpenBSD 7-current libc
        + Remove the unused "maintainer-clean" target from GNUmakefile
        + Build against the newly bundled OpenBSD Berkeley DB by default;
          the imperfect Berkeley DB 3/4/5 support will remain available

OpenVi 7.0.3 -> OpenVi 7.0.4: Wed Jan 26 13:09:45 2022
        + New feature: "set visibletab" (abbrev "set vt") which toggles
          displaying tabs visibly while editing, useful for Makefiles, etc
        + Decrease the width of the line-number column by one row
        + Increase the length of the divider decoration string (by 2x)
        + Improve the GNUmakefile to avoid remaking any non-stale targets
        + Portably seed the standard random number generator

OpenVi 7.0.2 -> OpenVi 7.0.3: Wed Jan 26 08:31:28 2022
        + GNUmakefile "install" target now installs docs (man pages)
        + Remove 'docs/internals/cscope.NOTES' and documentation references
        + General build, portability, and code readability improvements
        + Relicense new contributions under the same 3-clause BSD license
          used by the overall project and update LICENSE file text
        + Remove unused headers and legacy documentation from the sources

          uninstalled compiled binary
        + Set visible tab character to '~' and expose option in GNUmakefile
        + Installed binaries are prefixed with 'o' (e.g. 'ovi') by default
        + Explicitly invoke the POSIX-compliant version of the awk utility
        + Clarify (and simplify) GNUmakefile and build configuration
        + Update ChangeLog and docs for consistency, fix spelling and typos
        + Update LICENSE text

OpenVi 7.0.1 -> OpenVi 7.0.2: Tue Jan 25 13:44:48 2022
        + Debugging builds now default to compiling with '-Wall -Wextra'
        + Only pass '-pipe' to the compiler for non-debugging builds
        + Expand the formatting of the usage help text for readability
        + Change the DEBUG_VI GNUmakefile flag to simply DEBUG
        + For debug builds, document the existence of -T (Trace) in usage
        + Don't strip the binary by default; add "install-strip" target
        + Make clean targets more robust; warn if unable to remove 'bin'

OpenBSD 7.0 -> OpenVi 7.0.1: Mon Jan 24 10:37:28 2022
        + OpenVi created supporting glibc-based Linux systems
        + Create GNUmakefile and adapt build system
        + Attempt to detect and use mtmalloc or jemalloc if available
        + Support builds with post-1.8.5 BerkeleyDB versions (using BDB
          1.8.5 emulation) but at the expense of preservation and recovery
        + Create initial README.md stub

Mon Oct 25 14:17:24 2021
        + vi(1): fix use after free with unsaved buffer. Issuing a zero-arg
          ex_edit command (:e) while using a named buffer with no backing
          file caused vi(1)/ex(1) to free the strings representing the
          buffer name and the name of the temporary file. This change
          detects the situation and only frees the newly allocated EXF
          structure (ep). Reported on bugs@ by kn@. OK millert@

Sun Oct 24 21:24:15 2021
        + For open/openat, if the flags parameter does not contain
          O_CREAT, the 3rd (variadic) mode_t parameter is irrelevant
          Many developers in the past have passed mode_t (0, 044, 0644,
          or such), which might lead future people to copy this broken
          idiom, and perhaps even believe this parameter has some meaning
          or implication or application. Delete them all. This comes out of
          a conversation where tb@ noticed that a strange (but intentional)
          pledge behavior is to always knock-out high-bits from mode_t on a
          number of system calls as a safety factor, and his bewilderment
          that this appeared to be happening against valid modes (at least
          visually), but no sorry, they are all irrelevant junk. They could
          all be 0xdeafbeef. ok millert@

OpenBSD 6.9 -> OpenBSD 7.0: Thu Sep 2 11:19:02 2021
        + Make all signal handler functions async-signal-safe by
          deleting the redundant "killersig" struct member and using the
          existing sig_atomic_t cl_sigterm variable instead
        + While here, garbage collect the h_hup() signal handler which is
          essentially identical to h_term(). This also gets rid of the
          last #define & #undef in cl_main.c

Wed Sep 1 14:28:15 2021
        + As a first step towards safe signal handling, improve the
          h_int() and h_winch() signal handlers to make one single store
          to a sig_atomic_t variable. Note that the h_hup() and h_term()
          signal handlers are still unsafe after this commit because they
          also set the "killersig" (how fitting!) field in a global struct

OpenBSD 6.8 -> OpenBSD 6.9: Tue Apr 13 15:39:21 2021
        + Require that the argument to the window option be non-zero. A
          zero-row window would not be usable (no room to edit) and the
          code is full of assumptions that "sp->t_rows - 1" >= 0. From
          Erik Ruotsalainen, fixes a bug reported by Paul de Weerd
        + Ignore expandtab setting when in command mode. Fixes things like
          searching for a literal tab character when expandtab is enabled;
          from `nvi2` (leres); OK martijn@

Mon Mar 8 02:47:25 2021
        + Add some references, most of these were removed when we stopped
          building and installing USD/SMM/PSD docs

OpenBSD 6.7 -> OpenBSD 6.8: Tue Jan 26 18:19:43 2021
        + Satisfy -fno-common by repairing one enum decl; ok mortimer@

OpenBSD 6.6 -> OpenBSD 6.7: Sun May 24 13:33:55 2020
        + Correct one statement about how the 'm' command works, talk
          less about ancient terminals, employ the more usual term "caret"
          rather than "up-arrow", and fix a few minor nits

OpenBSD 6.5 -> OpenBSD 6.6: Thu Apr 30 10:40:21 2020
        + Add an expandtab option, similar to what vim supports. If set,
          expands tabs to spaces in insert mode as well as when shifting
          and indenting/outdenting. If quoted with ^V, a literal tab is
          inserted. Adapted from NetBSD, but this implementation more
          closely matches vim's behavior. OK dlg@

Fri Oct 4 20:12:01 2019
        + Better link "set" and "SET OPTIONS"; original diff from sven
          falempin, tweaked a bit by myself

Mon Jul 22 12:39:02 2019
        + In secure mode (-S), skip sending mail when executing the
          :pre[serve] command or when dying from SIGTERM. This way,
          creating the recovery file works again without re-adding "proc
          exec" to the pledge(2). As reported by Jesper Wallin <jesper
          at ifconfig dot se>, this got broken by common/main.c rev. 1.29
          (Nov 19, 2015). The general direction of the fix was suggested
          by brynet@. OK brynet@ and no opposition when shown on tech@

OpenBSD 6.4 -> OpenBSD 6.5: Tue May 21 09:24:58 2019
        + Also apply stricter pledge when secure mode is set via rc file
          or command

OpenBSD 6.3 -> OpenBSD 6.4: Thu Jan 24 15:09:41 2019
        + Fix a crash on long lines when switching to another file by
          setting SC_SCR_CENTER which will cause the offsets in HMAP to
          be reset when painting the screen. OK martijn@ otto@

Mon Sep 17 15:41:17 2018
        + Use the strict pragma for better warnings

Fri Jul 13 20:06:10 2018
        + Remove Cscope leftover and a stray comma
        + Unused variable

Wed Jul 11 06:39:23 2018
        + Remove an old (and false) comment. REALLOC now free(3)s
          the code if realloc fails

OpenBSD 6.2 -> OpenBSD 6.3: Mon Feb 12 01:10:46 2018
        + Simplify documentation of split-screen mode, avoiding abuse
          of [] to sometimes mean "character set", which conflicts with
          the normal meaning of "optional element" in manual pages
        + While here, add a few related clarifications and tweak a
          few details. Triggered by a minor bug report from <trondd at
          kagu-tsuchi dot com>, and by bentley@ subsequently pointing out
          the abuse of []. Patch using input from jmc@, who also agreed
          with some previous versions

Sat Feb 3 15:44:36 2018
        + The recover script should have the same sanity checks as
          recover.c. Specifically, open files with O_NONBLOCK and enforce
          a mode of 0600

Thu Dec 14 10:02:53 2017
        + Enable the awk scripts to generate ex_def.h and
          options_def.h. These scripts generate the enums required for
          the ex commands and vi options. Before these lists had to
          be maintained either by hand or someone had to stumble upon
          these scripts and figure out how to use them. By enabling them
          these headers are now always in sync based on the comments in
          the corresponding source files, which are a lot harder to miss
          during an update than an extra file

Sun Nov 26 09:59:41 2017
        + Fix segfault which could be triggered by deleting a backwards
          sentence if cursor's current line was blank:

Fri Nov 10 18:31:36 2017
        + When tracing is compiled in make sure it flushes its content
          to disk as soon as the TRACE function is called. This helps
          while debugging crashes
        + Fix a use after free when sending SIGHUP or SIGTERM to vi when
          in editing mode
        + Add rcv_openat() function that does the open, makes sure it
          is a regular file with the expected permissions and locks it
          Inspired by changes in NetBSD by Christos. OK martijn@
        + Avoid using system(3) when running "sendmail -t". We already
          have the recover file fd open so just run sendmail with stdin
          set to the recover file. OK martijn@

OpenBSD 6.1 -> OpenBSD 6.2: Tue Aug 22 20:27:18 2017
        + Do not treat comma as part of the command modifier

Mon Jul 31 19:45:49 2017
        + Silence some warnings generated by clang. Original diff by
          espie@ with some minor tweaks by myself

Thu Jul 20 08:37:48 2017
        + Replace usage of strtol() with strtonum()

Wed Jul 5 18:56:33 2017
        + Avoid double space caused by end-of-sentence detection
          requested by jmc@
        + Nits about trailing punctuation found with mandoc -Tlint

Mon Jul 3 14:30:11 2017
        + Markup fixes
        + Remove settings that were unimplemented for 20 years; update
          STANDARDS

Fri Jun 30 14:42:05 2017
        + Add mdoc(7) macros to vi's built-in lists of roff
          paragraph/section macros

Sat Jun 24 16:30:47 2017
        + Fix a check in ADD_SPACE_{GOTO,RET} that potentially allowed
          for a NULL-dereference

Tue Jun 20 07:32:56 2017
        + Better document the :s ex command and its variants

Thu Jun 15 06:44:47 2017
        + "10th's of a second" -> "tenths of a second"

Mon Jun 12 18:38:57 2017
        + Use openat() and unlinkat() instead of chdir()ing to the
          recovery dir. Since we use flock() and not fcntl() locking we
          can open the recovery file read-only. OK martijn@

Wed Apr 26 13:14:28 2017
        + Remove extraneous ", NULL" in the assignment of msgstr which was
          leftover from when msg_cat() was removed. From Anton Lindqvist

Tue Apr 18 01:45:33 2017
        + free(NULL) is ok so use it; from Michael W. Bombardieri

OpenBSD 6.0 -> OpenBSD 6.1: Fri Jan 20 00:55:52 2017
        + Nuke some excess whitespace

Sun Dec 18 18:28:38 2016
        + Use %zu/%d to print size_t/ssize_t. Cast recno_t
          (a.k.a. u_int32_t) to (unsigned long) to match %lu formats. Makes
          gcc happier and quieter
        + Nuke more unused variables

Sat Nov 5 16:21:56 2016
        + Remove syscall.ph from vi.recover

Fri Sep 2 15:38:42 2016
        + Fix the begin of word issue in vi(1). Similar fix went in sed
          and ed

OpenBSD 5.9 -> OpenBSD 6.0: Sat Aug 27 04:07:42 2016
        + Pull in <sys/time.h> for struct timespec and timeval

Sun Aug 14 21:47:16 2016
        + Kill '#if defined(DEBUG) && 0' blocks that used %q

Mon Aug 8 15:09:32 2016
        + /tmp and /var/tmp are the same, consistently use the former
          in both build/recover and documentation

Mon Aug 1 18:27:35 2016
        + Remove vi's "directory" option and TMPDIR support

Thu Jul 7 09:26:25 2016
        + biff, mesg, vi: only consider ACCESSPERMS for setting tty mode

Wed Jun 29 20:38:39 2016
        + If /tmp/vi.recover doesn't exist, don't create it. Warn once
          that it doesn't exist, afterwards fail silently

Sat May 28 18:30:35 2016
        + Test if stdin is a terminal before resetting the tty state. Diff
          supplied by Kai Antweiler

Fri May 27 09:18:11 2016
        + Revert CHAR_T removal. Some signedness flaws were
          introduced. Found the hard way by jca@

Sat May 7 14:03:01 2016
        + Free memory if realloc fails. The application is most likely
          to terminate after a failure, but if it does not we better clean
          up after ourselves

Thu May 5 20:36:41 2016
        + Remove __sigblockset. This is a leftover after the removal of
          the signal blocking code in common/gs.h rev 1.14

Mon May 2 20:51:35 2016
        + Remove pointless comment. getcwd(3) is safe
        + Remove CHAR_T in favor of native types

Wed Apr 20 19:34:32 2016
        + Remove pointless reenter variable

Tue Apr 19 17:42:09 2016
        + Remove not implemented declaration of sscr_pty
        + Remove some useless code

Wed Mar 30 06:38:40 2016
        + For some time now mandoc has not required MLINKS to function
          correctly; logically complete that now by removing MLINKS
          from base

OpenBSD 5.8 -> OpenBSD 5.9: Sat Mar 19 00:21:28 2016
        + By issuing :e +something in vi(1) this uncovers a backwards
          memcpy with the code because the 2 buffers overlap and in order
          to solve it then replace memcpy(3) call by memmove(3)

Thu Mar 17 03:44:05 2016
        + Add error checking for COLUMNS/LINES environment variables

Sun Mar 13 18:30:43 2016
        + Remove an extra space before ^\ help message. Fixes alignment
          in viusage

Thu Feb 11 16:34:12 2016
        + Update comment: the #ifdef VDSUSP was removed in r1.22

Tue Feb 9 07:41:12 2016
        + Avoid special characters; from Michael Reed

Wed Feb 3 01:47:25 2016
        + Remove needless alias macros for malloc and calloc. No binary
          change. I got this up-streamed a few weeks ago

Sat Jan 30 21:34:57 2016
        + /var/tmp is dead, long live /tmp
        + Replace tail with basename

Wed Jan 27 22:46:02 2016
        + remove v_estr in favor of warn and warnx

Wed Jan 27 22:38:12 2016
        + Replace fprintf+exit with errx. No functional change

Wed Jan 20 08:43:27 2016
        + Remove ARG_CHAR_T, a relic from when the code was written
          K&R style

Sat Jan 9 16:13:26 2016
        + decls before code; from Martijn van Duren

Wed Jan 6 22:46:59 2016
        + Remove mention of message catalog dir
        + We don't use configure so this file is full of lies and we
          are better off without it
        + Remove msgcat from the documentation
        + Remove prototype for now-deleted f_msgcat()
        + Remove the actual message catalogs. From Martijn van Duren
        + Remove the msg_cat() function and adjust its former
          callers. From Martijn van Duren
        + Remove the numeric identifiers at the beginning of the messages
          which used to be used as the message number to lookup in the
          catalog. From Martijn van Duren
        + Remove the message catalog DB. This removes the msg_open()
          and msg_close() functions along with the msgcat command. From
          Martijn van Duren

Mon Dec 28 19:24:01 2015
        + Use err() instead of custom perr() function. Also applied by
          `nvi2` upstream; From Martijn van Duren

Mon Dec 7 20:39:19 2015
        + Remove needless type casts and corresponding type parameters
          from allocation macros. No binary change

Thu Dec 3 08:13:15 2015
        + After inserting a backslash, don't treat ^H ^? or ^U as special
          cases. These days, ^V to escape is a universal feature and
          needing two keystrokes to delete backslashes is really annoying

Tue Nov 24 12:56:31 2015
        + Update the other documentation to match the new filec default
        + Turn on filename tab completion in vi by default

Mon Nov 23 09:03:01 2015
        + Remove Cscope references in documentation

Fri Nov 20 04:12:19 2015

OpenBSD 5.7 -> OpenBSD 5.8: Sun Nov 15 01:22:36 2015
        + Vi needs flock, for those who haven't set nolock in .exrc
          for years
        + Basic pledge for vi

Mon Sep 14 20:06:58 2015
        + Avoid .Ns right after .Pf, it's pointless
        + In some cases, do additional cleanup in the immediate vicinity

Tue Jul 7 18:34:12 2015
        + Fix a regression caused by timespec changes when vi is run
          without a file to edit. Based on a diff from Patrick Keshishian

OpenBSD 5.6 -> OpenBSD 5.7: Fri Apr 24 21:48:31 2015
        + struct timespec/clock_gettime(3) conversion for vi(1)

Tue Apr 21 01:41:42 2015

          twice ok deraadt@ guenther@ miod@ millert@

Sun Apr 19 01:10:59 2015
        + Don't lock the file for "vi -R" or "view". OK deraadt@

Fri Apr 10 18:05:51 2015
        + This changes vi to use resizeterm(3) instead of re-initializing
          curses on window re-sizes, which was leaking massive amounts
          of memory

Sun Mar 29 01:04:23 2015
        + Remove SA_INTERRUPT, HISTORIC_PRACTICE, and HISTORICAL_PRACTICE
          using unifdef. It seems clear that no one was using these
          (SA_INTERRUPT didn't even build the other way). Tweak comments
          as appropriate

Sat Mar 28 12:54:37 2015
        + vi was using two separate isblank functions: one defined in
          <ctype.h> and the other #defined in common/key.h. There is no
          reason to have both. For consistency use the isblank function
          from <ctype.h>, remove the #define in common/key.h, and add
          #include <ctype.h> to the files that were missing the header

Fri Mar 27 04:11:25 2015
        + Some vi cleanup, unifdef's some signal blocking code that has
          never been enabled in our tree, also removes some stragglers
          from a global struct referencing nonexistent Tcl/TK and "IP
          support". And finally.. delete an empty file missed by earlier
          cleanup by bentley@

Tue Mar 17 10:08:18 2015
        + Don't use the wrong escape for < and >. Tweak wording to match
          the page

Fri Mar 13 19:58:40 2015
        + Remove the first comma from constructs like ", and," and
          ", or,": you can use "and" and "or" to join sentence clauses,
          and you can use commas, but both hinders reading

Tue Mar 10 00:10:59 2015
        + Display "Search wrapped" even when searching from the end of
          the file

Sat Feb 28 21:51:56 2015
        + Reduce usage of predefined strings in man pages

Fri Feb 6 22:29:31 2015
        + Do not rely on unspecified behavior for the size_t overflow
          check. OK miod@

Fri Jan 16 06:39:28 2015
        + Replace <sys/param.h> with <limits.h> and other less dirty
          headers where possible
        + Annotate <sys/param.h> lines with their current reasons
        + Switch to PATH_MAX, NGROUPS_MAX, HOST_NAME_MAX+1, LOGIN_NAME_MAX
        + Change MIN() and MAX() to local definitions of MINIMUM() and
          MAXIMUM() where sensible to avoid pulling in the pollution. These
          are the files confirmed through binary verification. ok guenther@,
          millert@, doug@ (helped with the verification protocol)

Thu Nov 20 08:50:53 2014
        + Remove the vi Perl API

Wed Nov 19 03:42:40 2014
        + Remove ifdef checks for LIBRARY. It is undocumented and triggers

          unconditionally
        + The 'tcl' command in vi does nothing, except to print the message
          "Vi was not loaded with a Tcl interpreter". Printing the standard

          benefit of reducing code size
        + The vi editor contains code for two different file locking
          methods; one using flock(), the other using fcntl(). The fcntl

          These id's do not provide any benefit, and do hurt the small

OpenBSD 4.5 -> OpenBSD 4.6: Tue Oct 20 09:54:47 2009

          original printed edition of the User's Reference Manual from
          USENIX and O'Reilly. 4.4BSD had exactly this, that is much
          more accurate than our current description (while here, Jason
          observed that both FreeBSD and NetBSD do the same)

          exist for it). OK jmc@
        + There is no typewriter font in nroff so just use the roman font
          instead. Fixes bizarre font problems formatting vi.ref via nroff
          OK jmc@
        + Use a 5n margin on the right & left sides so the text version
          formats nicely. OK jmc@

          where foo does not exist and has no recovery file that vi shall
          present an error and edit foo as a new file. This change makes

          to copy 0 characters, and use ENTIRE_LINE instead of hard coding

        + When creating temp files, use fchmod() to set the perms to be
          what we expect since the mode mkstemp() uses can be modified by
          the umask. This fixes a problem where vi would spin trying to
          create temp files, eating up inodes; reported by xyntrix@bitz.org

          and non-zero

Fri Apr 21 17:06:13 2000
        + Remove the races so that this is safe to run anytime. We open
          /var/tmp/vi.recover to get an fd and user O_NOFOLLOW to following

          chdir to the right place and form then on do operations relative
          to ".". Also restrict to root

Thu Apr 20 15:24:24 2000
        + If recovery dir is not owned by root, chown it. If the mode
          is not 01777, fix that too. This is safe because the script is

OpenBSD 2.5 -> OpenBSD 2.6: Thu Jan 20 18:19:45 2000
        + Use sysopen() when opening recover files. This is purely
          paranoia since we check that the filename matches '^recover'
          and hence the first character cannot play games with Perl's
          magic open()

        + Add the windowname edit option and code to change the icon/window
          name for xterm's
        + Enhance the comment edit option to skip shell comments
        + Add conditional prototypes to replacement C library functions
        + Minor enhancements/reworking to Makefile.in, other build files
        + Fix bug in vi text input ^D processing, could result in cursor
          warp to the beginning of the line
        + Fix leftright screen bug where the screen wasn't repainted when
          being repainted from scratch
        + Update the Swedish and Dutch catalogs
        + Truncate paths in write commands if they don't fit on one line
        + Fix alternate screen bug where the screen flashed and output lost
          when switching to/from the X11 xterm alternate screen. Fix bug
          where nvi switched into the alternate screen during filter-read
          commands, which doesn't match historic practice
        + Minor relative cursor positioning change, make cursor position
          changes from ex real and permanent

Nvi 1.67 -> Nvi 1.68: 6/9/1996
        + Fix core dump when tagging out of a modified file

Nvi 1.66 -> Nvi 1.67: 6/9/1996
        + Convert the license to adware
        + Leftright scrolling tweak, don't repaint the screen as often
        + Change so that search warning/error messages don't appear during
          an incremental search
        + Cscope fix: test for files newer than the database was reversed
        + Don't display ex `welcome message' if in ex batch mode
        + Test for vsnprintf and snprintf separately, HP 10.10 has snprintf
          but not vsnprintf
        + Reverse lookup order between LC_MESSAGES and LANG
        + Fix Tcl/Perl core dumps in common API code to get/set options
        + Fix R command - it used a DB pinned page after discarding it
        + Minor fixes in multiple edit buffer message handling code
        + Fix yk command moving to shorter line core dump
        + Rework message handling to try and gang more messages onto a
          single line

Nvi 1.65 -> Nvi 1.66: 5/18/1996
        + Convert vi man page to historic -man macro package, and install it
        + Fix bug were !! on an empty line with a nonexistent command left
          the cursor on the second character, not the first
        + Fix bug where line redisplay was wrong when a <tab> replaced a
          previous <tab> in the line
        + Fix bug where D (d$) didn't reset the relative cursor position
        + Fix bug where yG incorrectly reset the relative cursor position
        + Fix bug where the window size couldn't be grown once it was shrunk
        + Fix bug where the extended edit option caused tag searches to fail
        + If multiple lines in the tags file with the same leading tag,
          build a tags stack like the Cscope stack. This is the obvious
          extension, and the way that Larry McVoy's ctags program works
        + Send the appropriate TI/TE sequence in the curses screen whenever
          entering ex/vi mode. This means that :shell now shows the correct
          screen when using xterm alternate screens
        + Rework the options display code to get five columns in an 80
          column screen
        + Interactive UNIX V3.0 port - mostly file name shortening, other
          minor changes. Only preliminary, more work will be necessary
        + Add debugging option to not read EXINIT/.exrc information
        + Fix bug where re_compile printed an error message to the screen
          when the user entered [ to an incremental search
        + Turn off screen beeps when incremental search is failing
        + Fix bug where the iclower option didn't trigger an RE
          recompilation
        + Fix bug where -t into an already locked file forced the user to
          wait as if a startup command had failed
        + LynxOS port - mostly adding <sys/types.h> even though
          <sys/param.h> was already included
        + Fix ex output bug, where it appeared as if an ex command was
          skipped due to flags not being cleared in the vs_msg() routine
        + Fix core dump when global command tried to switch screens

Nvi 1.64 -> Nvi 1.65: 5/13/1996
        + Fix Cscope <blank>-matching pattern to use extended RE's, and bug
          that kept Cscope from finding patterns containing <blank>s
        + Fix core dumps in both leftright and folded screens when tabstops
          edit option value was large, and tab characters occurred as the
          last character in the logical screen
        + Fix core dump where the second screen of a folded line wasn't
          displayed correctly
        + Fix incremental search to match the current location for strings
          starting with \< patterns
        + Fix bug where margins were ignored during replay of text input
        + Fix bug where motion components to shorter lines could lose
          because the relative motion flags weren't ever set. This has been
          broken forever, but the change almost certainly breaks something
          else - I have no idea what
        + Tags display: don't print the current entry separately, display
          them all and add a trailing asterisk for the current one
        + Change the Cscope add command to put the directory name through
          standard file name expansion
        + Fix Cscope use of buffers - search commands weren't NULL-
          terminated

Nvi 1.63 -> Nvi 1.64: 5/8/1996
        + Add installation target to the Makefile
        + Add documentation on the new tags commands to the Vi Reference
          Manual
        + Make the sidescroll edit option work again
        + Fix bug where messages output during startup by ex could be lost
        + Change ex/vi commands errors into beeps, unless the verbose edit
          option is set - there are too many macros that are expected to
          eventually fail. This matches historic practice
        + Truncate paths in initial vi screen if they won't fit on one line
        + Make cursor position after filter write match historic practice
        + Force the user to wait if there is output and the user is leaving
          the screen for any reason - don't permit further ex commands
        + Don't use a <newline> character to scroll the screen when exiting,
          scroll in the vi screen before endwin() is called
        + Fix bug where the column number could be incorrect because the old
          screen wasn't updated after a screen split
        + Fix ex print routine to correctly specify print flags
        + Make -g/-O a separate make/configuration option
        + Fix bug where ex/vi messages weren't being joined
        + Fix bug where termcap strings were free'd twice
        + Fix bug where TI/TE still weren't working - I didn't put in the
          translation strings for BSD style curses
        + Fix bug where I misspelled the iclower edit option as icloser

Nvi 1.62 -> Nvi 1.63: 4/29/1996
        + Robustness and type/lint fixes for the Tcl interface code
        + Fix core dump if TERM wasn't set or terminal type was unknown
        + Fix bug where combining ex commands that did/did not require an
          ex screen would overwrite the command with the want-to-continue
          message
        + Fix bug where the screen was never resolved if the user continued
          entering ex commands using the : character, but then backspaced
          over the prompt to quit or tried to edit their colon command-line
          history
        + Fix bug where cursor wasn't placed over the ^ placeholder
          character when quoting using the literal-next character
        + Fix bug where nvi under BSD style curses wasn't sending TI/TE
          termcap strings when suspending the process
        + Rename mic again, to iclower
        + Fix bug where 'z' commands trailing / or ? commands weren't being
          executed
        + Change incremental search to leave the cursor at its last position
          when searching for something that was never found
        + Fix bug where search-with-confirmation from vi mode didn't
          position the cursor correctly after displaying the confirm message
        + Fix bug where the "search wrapped" message was dependent on the
          verbose edit option, which doesn't match historic practice. Change
          search messages to be in inverse video
        + Fix bug where matched showmatch character wasn't being displayed
          before the matching character was displayed
        + Another cursor update bug required a change to vs_paint()
        + Fix bug were initial line offset was wrong for the first split
          screen (symptom is very strange column numbers and blank first
          line)
        + Create filename "argument" lists when creating new screens
        + Fix bug where globals with associated commands that included both
          buffer execution and other commands could fail to execute the
          latter

Nvi 1.61 -> Nvi 1.62: 4/22/1996
        + Rename the "searchci" edit option to be "mic"
        + Fix memory corruption in global commands ending in searches
        + Fix text resolution bug, corrected the cursor based on the
          first line input, not the last
        + Rework the readonly edit option to match historic practice
        + Fix several minor incremental search bugs; make incremental
          searches work in maps
        + Fix long-line core dump, where an incorrect screen map could be
          used

Nvi 1.60 -> Nvi 1.61: 4/12/1996
        + The cursor now ends up on the FIRST character of the put text for
          all versions of the vi put commands, regardless of the source
          of the text. This matches System III/V behavior and POSIX 1003.2
        + Fixed bug where showmatch messages were getting discarded
        + Minor Perl integration fixes
        + Integrate Cscope into the tags stack code - major change
        + Fixed bug where ^T would drop core if returning to a temporary
          file
        + Changed vs_ routine to display ex output to replace tab characters
          with spaces
        + Fix autoindent code to not back up past beginning of line when ^T
          inserted into the middle of a line, i.e. offset != 0
        + Fix "notimeout" option, was being ignored, by a coding error
        + Fix showmatch code to never flash on a match if keys are waiting
        + Change the vi 'D' command to ignore any supplied count, matching
          historic practice
        + Fix viusage for D, S, C and Y (the aliased vi commands)
        + Fix the Perl5 configuration bug in the configuration script
        + Make file completion commands in empty lines work
        + Fix where the change to let vi use the default ex command
          structure broke the ex specification of the script or source file
          name
        + Fix to free saved RE structures when screens exit. This is a major
          RE change, which fixed several bugs in the handling of saved/subst
          RE's. It's likely to have added new bugs, however
        + Add case-independent searching (the searchci edit option)
        + Add incremental search (the searchincr edit option)
        + Home the cursor when executing ex commands from vi

Nvi 1.59 -> Nvi 1.60: 3/29/1996
        + Fix ":w >>" core dump, make that command match historic practice
        + Fix autoindent bug where the length of the line was incorrectly
          calculated
        + Fix cursor bug where cursor could end up at the wrong place if the
          movement keys were entered quickly enough
        + Change the read/write whirling indicator to appear only every 1/4
          second, clean up the appearance
        + Don't change the options real values until underlying functions
          have returned OK - fix "set tabstop=0" core dump
        + Fix resizing on Sun's: use SA_INTERRUPT to interrupt read calls
        + Fix two forward mark command bugs: one where it wasn't setting the
          "favorite cursor" position because of the refresh optimization,
          and one where it didn't have VM_RCM_SET set in the command flags
          for some reason
        + Fix a bug were the 's' command on top of a <tab> didn't correctly
          copy the buffer
        + Make :exusage command work for commands having optional leading
          capital letters, e.g. Next
        + Previous changes broke the inital-matching-prefix code in the key
          mapping part of v_event_get - fix it, and fix the infinite macro
          interrupt code at the same time
        + Add "cedit" edit option, so colon command-line editing is optional
          Change filec/cedit so that you can set them to the same character,
          and they do cedit if in column 1, and filec otherwise
        + Fix "source of non-existent file" core dump
        + Fix bug where functions keys specified in startup information were
          never resolved/activated
        + Fix v_txt bug where could infinitely loop if <escape> triggered an
          abbreviation expansion
        + Move version string into VERSION file, out of ex_version.c

Nvi 1.58 -> Nvi 1.59
        + Configuration changes, several minor bug fixes, including a few
          core dumps. No functional changes

Nvi 1.57 -> Nvi 1.58
        + Fix the problem where colon command-line temporary files were
          getting left in /tmp
        + Fix the configuration scripts to quit immediately if the Perl
          or Tk/Tcl libraries are specified but not found
        + Several screen fixes - the changes in 1.57 weren't as safe as
          I thought. More specifically, the refresh-only-if-waiting change
          caused a lot of problems. In general, fixing them should provide
          even more speedup, but I'm nervous
        + Lots of changes in the configuration scripts, hopefully this is
          just a first-round ordeal
        + Several other minor bug fixes

Nvi 1.56 -> Nvi 1.57
        + Add <esc> hook to colon commands, so you can edit colon commands
        + Add Perl5 interpreter
        + Change shell expansion code to fail if it doesn't read at least
          one non-blank character from the shell. If the shell expansion
          process fails, or if not at least one non-blank character, it
          now displays an error message to the user
        + Rework the screen display so that it matches the historic vi
          screen refreshes
        + Rework options processing: print/noprint are no longer cumulative,
          provide more information to underlying edit options modules, move
          O_MESG information into the screen specific code
        + Make file completion character settable
        + Rework terminal restart - you can now use ":set term" to switch
          terminal types. This cleaned up screen resizing considerably
        + Character display fix, display \177 as ^?, not in hex/octal
        + Tag search bug fix, don't repeat search if successful
        + Replace sys_siglist[] use with private sigmsg() routine
        + Fix core dump if illegal screenId specified to Tcl routine
        + Add get/set mark interface to Tcl Interpreter interface
        + Fix core dump if file expansion code stressed (re: filec edit
          option)
        + Fix bug where filter commands in empty files couldn't find line 0
        + Switch to GNU autoconf 2.7 for configuration, delete nvi/PORT
        + Many random portability fixes

Nvi 1.55 -> Nvi 1.56: 11/26/1995
        + Bug fix release - generally available beta release

Nvi 1.54 -> Nvi 1.55: 11/18/1995
        + Bug fix release
        + Integrate Tcl interpreter

Nvi 1.53 -> Nvi 1.54: 11/11/1995
        + Bug fix release. A major change in reworking the ex commands, when
          called from the colon command line, to match historic practice,
          and permit them to be entered repeatedly after ex has trashed
          the screen
        + Use restart-able endwin() from System V curses to implement
          screen suspend

Nvi 1.52 -> Nvi 1.53: 10/29/1995
        + Switch to using vendor's curses library for all ports
        + Back out the event driven version, leaving screen separation
        + User configuration of <escape> timeout (the escapetime edit
          option)
        + Add Tcl/Tk screen support
        + Add file name completion (the filec edit option)
        + Disallow access to outside applications (the secure edit option)

Nvi 1.51 -> Nvi 1.52: 7/26/1995
        + Minor cleanups
        + Snapshot for SMI

Nvi 1.50 -> Nvi 1.51: 7/5/1995
        + Lots and lots of changes for event driven model, largely in moving
          the boundary between the screen code and the editor up and down
          Private release for Rob Zimmermann @ Tartan and Bill Shannon @ SMI

Nvi 1.49 -> Nvi 1.50: Fri Jun 9 13:56:17 1995
        + Minor bug fixes for stability
        + Convert to an event driven model, with the usual Nachos Supreme
          layering that results. This is a completely new version, nothing
          done previously matters any more

Nvi 1.48 -> Nvi 1.49: Wed Mar 8 10:42:17 1995
        + Changes in 1.46 broke ^A processing
        + Add :previous to split screen commands
        + Lots o' random bug fixes - passes purify testing again

Nvi 1.47 -> Nvi 1.48: Thu Feb 9 18:13:29 1995
        + Random bug fixes for 1.47
        + Move the FREF (file structure) list out of the screen and into
          the global area
        + Change semantics to :E to more closely match :e - ":E" joins
          the current file, so ":E /tmp" is now the command to match the
          historic ":split"

Nvi 1.46 -> Nvi 1.47: Wed Feb 8 19:43:41 1995
        + All ex commands (including visual and excluding global and v)
          are now supported inside ex global commands
        + Rework the append/change/insert commands to match historic
          practice for text appended to the ex command line, and inside
          of ex global commands
        + Restructure to make single-line screens work
        + Restructure to create curses independent screen routines
        + Restructure to permit Edit, Next, and Tag routines to create new
          screens on the fly
        + Change hexadecimal output to be \x## instead of 0x##
        + Change ex commands run from vi to stay in vi mode for as long as
          possible, i.e. until ex modifies the screen outside of the editor

Nvi 1.45 -> Nvi 1.46: Tue Jan 24 10:22:27 1995
        + Restructure to build as a library

Nvi 1.44 -> Nvi 1.45: Thu Jan 12 21:33:06 1995
        + Fix relative cursor motion to handle folded lines
        + Recompile the search pattern if applicable edit options change
        + Change +/-c command ordering to match historic practice
        + Rework autoindent code to always resolve preceding <blank>
          characters when a ^T or ^D are entered
        + Add the print/noprint edit options, so can now specify if
          a character is printable
        + Change ex to run in canonical mode
        + Fix ex text input to support the number edit option
        + Vi text input fix for the R command to correctly restore
          characters entered and then backspaced over
        + Several vi increment command fixes

Nvi 1.43 -> Nvi 1.44
        + Bug fix, vi was printing the last line number on the status line
          at startup. Change to execute commands at first line set,
          i.e. "vi -t tag -c cmd" executes cmd at the tag line, not EOF

Nvi 1.42 -> Nvi 1.43: Sat Dec 3 13:11:32 1994
        + Marks, SunOS signed comparison fix for 1.42

Nvi 1.41 -> Nvi 1.42: Fri Dec 2 20:08:16 1994
        + Make autowrite require the file not be read-only
        + Make the ex insert command work in empty files
        + Tab expansion is no longer limited to values < 20 (which matches
          historical practice)
        + Simplify (and fix limit detection for) the # command. It's no
          longer possible to use the # command itself to repeat or modify
          a previous # command, '.' is the only possibility
        + Lots more reworking of the ex addresses, putting ? and / into
          the ex addressing code broke the world
        + Make the Put, Preserve and Print commands work (don't ask)
        + Split stdout/stderr from shell expansions; stdout is expansion
          text, stderr is entered on the message queue

Nvi 1.40 -> Nvi 1.41: Fri Nov 18 16:13:52 1994
        + Addition of a port for AUX 3.1
        + Addition of a message catalog for Russian
        + Make vi ? and / commands be true ex addresses (historic practice)
        + Display the date first in vi -r recovery list

Nvi 1.39 -> Nvi 1.40: Mon Nov 14 10:46:56 1994
        + Two bug fixes for 1.39; -r option and v_change core dump

Nvi 1.38 -> Nvi 1.39: Sun Nov 13 18:04:08 1994
        + Ex substitution with confirmation now matches historic practice
          (except that it still runs in raw mode, not cooked)
        + Nvi now clears the screen before painting, if repainting the
          entire screen
        + Fix final cursor position for put command entering text in a
          single line
        + Change to break error message lines on the last <blank> in the
          line
        + Always center the current line when returning to a previously
          edited file or moving to a tag line that's not visible on the
          screen
        + Change write of the current file using an explicit name or % to
          match the semantics of :w<CR>, not :w file<CR>
        + Add command aliases to vi, and remap 6 historic commands to their
          historic counterparts: D->d$, Y->y_, S->c_, C->c$, A->$a, I->^i
        + Match option display to historic practice; if boolean or numeric
          options changed to default values, not displayed by default
          Nvi treats string options the same way, vi always displayed any
          string option that was changed
        + Added lock edit option, if not set, no file locking is done
        + Rework ex to permit any ex command in the EXINIT variable or
          exrc startup files. This fixes the bug were `vi +100 file'
          painted the screen and then moved to line 100 and repainted
          (Yanked to SCCS ID 9.1.)
        + Bug fix: could report file modified more recently than it was
          written, incorrectly
        + Search fix: historically, motions with deltas were not corrected
          to the previous/next line based on the starting/stopping column
        + Addressing fixes: make trailing non-existent addresses work,
          change % to be text substitution, not a unique address (to follow
          future POSIX)

Nvi 1.37 -> Nvi 1.38: Mon Oct 24 12:51:58 1994
        + Scrolling fix; ^B can move to nonexistent lines
        + Fix to vi mapped commands; <escape> characters while already in
          command mode did not historically cause the mapped characters to
          be flushed
        + Add the backup edit option, automatically version edit files
        + Make it possible to edit files that db can't read, i.e. edit a
          temporary file, with the correct file name
        + Only anchor the last line of the file to the bottom line of the
          screen if there's half or less of a screen between the target
          line and the end of the file
        + Fix wrapmargin text allocation bug
        + Fix ex put command to work in any empty file
        + Fix global command to handle move's to line 0 correctly
        + Regularize the yank cursor motions, several bug fixes for historic
          practice
        + Fix N and n, when used as a motion command for the ! command,
          repeat the last bang command instead of prompting for a new
          one
        + Timeout maps beginning with <escape> quickly, instead of based
          on the keytime option
        + Bug fix for wraplen option, wasn't triggered for input commands

Nvi 1.36 -> Nvi 1.37: Sun Oct 9 19:02:53 1994

        + Fix ^A to set search direction and pattern for consistency
        + Fold the showdirty option into the showmode option
        + Ex addressing fix: change search offset and line arguments
          (e.g. the copy command) to be ex addressing offsets, matching
          historic practice
        + Ex addressing fix: support ^ as an offset/flag equivalent to -
        + Ex addressing fix: historically, any missing address defaulted to
          dot, e.g. "4,,," was the same as ".,."
        + Ex addressing fix: historically, <blank> separated numbers were
          additive, e.g. "3 5p" displayed line 8
        + Ex addressing fix: make ';' as a range delimiter match historic
          practice
        + Change nvi to exit immediately if stdout isn't a terminal
        + Change alternate file name behavior to match historic practice,
          make the :write command set the current file name
        + Text input fix; input keys from a map, with an associated count,
          weren't historically affected by the wrapmargin value
        + Add wraplen option, same as wrapmargin, but from the left-hand
          column, not the right
        + Make ex address .<number> be equivalent to .+<number>, i.e. the
          '+' is understood; matches historic practice, and it's widely
          documented for ed(1)
        + Input mode ^V^J historically mapped into a single ^J
        + Minor catalog changes, fixes; don't use 's' to pluralize words

        + Fix ^D autoindent bug by resolving leading <blank>s at ^D
        + Rework abbreviation tests (again!) to match historic practice
        + Change ^D/^U default scrolling value to be based on window option
          value, not screen lines, correct scrolling option value, both to
          match historic practice. NOTE: System V does this differently!

Nvi 1.34 -> Nvi 1.35: Wed Aug 31 19:20:15 1994
        + Add the historic -l option
        + Message catalogs
        + Display global messages at each flush, just in case some are there
        + Fix global substitute code, `\\' wasn't handled correctly
        + Fix abbreviation code to use <blank>s as the preceding character
        + Fix ruler to display logical column, not physical column
        + Block signals when user issues :preserve command, so no race
          caused by SIGHUP/SIGTERM

Nvi 1.33 -> Nvi 1.34: Wed Aug 17 14:37:32 1994
        + Back out sccsid string fix, it won't work on SunOS 4.1

Nvi 1.32 -> Nvi 1.33: Wed Aug 17 09:31:41 1994
        + Get back 5K of data space for the sccsid strings
        + Fix bug where cG fix in version 1.31 broke cw cursor positioning

        + Fix core dump in map/seq code if character larger than 7 bits
        + Block signals when manipulating the SCR chains

Nvi 1.31 -> Nvi 1.32: Mon Aug 15 14:27:49 1994
        + Turn off recno mmap call for Solaris 2.4/SunOS 5.4

Nvi 1.30 -> Nvi 1.31: Sun Aug 14 13:13:35 1994
        + Fix bug were cG on the last line of a file wasn't done in line
          mode, and where the cursor wasn't positioned correctly after
          exiting text insert mode
        + Add termcap workaround to make function keys greater than 9 work
          correctly (or fail if old-style termcap support)
        + Change ex/vi to not flush mapped keys on error - this is historic
          practice, and people depended on it
        + Rework vi parser so that no command including a mapped key ever
          becomes the '.' command, matching historic practice
        + Make <escape> cancellation in the vi parser match POSIX 1003.2
        + Fix curses bug where standout string was written for each standout
          character, and where standout mode was never exited explicitly
          Fix bugs in curses SF/sf and SR/sr scrolling, as seen on Sun and
          x86 consoles
        + The v/global commands execute the print command by default
        + The number option historically applies to ex as well as vi

Nvi 1.29 -> Nvi 1.30: Mon Aug 8 10:30:42 1994
        + Make first read into a temporary set the file's name
        + Permit any key to continue scrolling or ex commands - this
          allows stacked colon commands, and matches historic practice
        + Don't output normal ! command commentary in ex silent mode
        + Allow +/- flags after substitute commands, make line (flag)
          offsets from vi mode match historic practice
        + Return <eof> to ex immediately, even if preceded by spaces. Rework
          ex parser to do erase the prompt instead of depending on the print
          routines to do it. Minor fixes to the ex parser for display of
          default and scrolling commands. MORE EX PARSER CHANGES

Nvi 1.28 -> Nvi 1.29: Fri Aug 5 10:18:07 1994
        + Make the abbreviated ex delete command work (:dele---###lll for
          example, is historically legal
        + When autoprint fires, multiple flags may be set, use ex_print
          directly instead of the stub routines
        + Change v/global commands to turn off autoprint while running
        + Minor changes to make the ! command display match historic output
        + Rework the ex parser to permit multiple command separators without
          commands - MAJOR CHANGE, likely to introduce all sorts of new bugs
        + Fix cd command to expand argument in the context of each element
          of the cdpath option, make relative paths always relative to the
          current directory

          discard them accidentally
        + Check for window size changes when continuing after a suspend
        + Fix memory problem in svi_screen, used free'd memory
        + Change the ex change, insert, append commands to match historic
          cursor positions if no data entered by the user
        + Change ex format flags (#, l, p) to affect future commands, not
          just the current one, to match historic practice
        + Make the user's EOF character an additional scroll character in ex
        + Fix ex ^D scrolling to be the value of the scroll option, not half
          the screen

          '*' command didn't work, and @<carriage-return> didn't work
        + Fix doubled reporting of deleted lines in filters
        + Rework the % ` / ? ( ) N n { and ^A commands to always cut into
          numeric buffers regardless of the location or length of the cut
          This matches historic practice
        + Fix the { command to check the current line if the cursor doesn't
          start on the first character of the line
        + Do '!' expansion in the ex read command arguments, it's historic
          practice. In addition, it sets the last '!' command

Nvi 1.27 -> Nvi 1.28: Wed Jul 27 21:29:18 1994
        + Add support for scrolling using the CS and SF/sf/SR/sr termcap
          strings to the 4BSD curses
        + Rework of getkey() introduced a bug where command interrupt put
          nvi into an infinite loop
        + Piping through a filter historically cut the replaced lines into
          the default buffer, although not the numeric ones
        + Read of a filter and !! historically moved to the first nonblank
          of the resulting cursor line (most of the time)
        + Rework cursor motion flags, to support '!' as a motion command

Nvi 1.26 -> Nvi 1.27: Tue Jul 26 10:27:58 1994
        + Add the meta option, to specify characters the shell will expand

          and bang characters weren't getting parsed correctly
        + Change SIGALRM handler to save and restore errno
        + Change SunOS include/compat.h to include <vfork.h> so that the
          ex/filter.c code works again
        + Don't put lines deleted by the ex delete command into the numeric
          buffers, matching historic practice
        + Fix; if appending to a buffer, default buffer historically only
          references the appended text, not the resulting text
        + Support multiple, semi-colon separated search strings, and 'z'
          commands after search strings
        + Make previous context mark setting match historic practice (see
          docs/internals/context)
        + Fix the set command to permit whitespace between the option and
          the question mark, fix question marks in general
        + Fix bug where ex error messages could be accidentally preceded
          by a single space
        + Fix bug where curses reorganization could lose screen specific
          mappings as soon as any screen exited
        + Fix bug in paragraph code where invalid macros could be matched
        + Make paragraph motions stop at formfeed (^L) characters
        + Change 'c' to match historic practice, it cut text into numeric
          buffers

Nvi 1.25 -> Nvi 1.26: Tue Jul 19 17:46:24 1994
        + Ignore SIGWINCH if the screen size is unchanged; SunOS systems
          deliver one when a screen is uncovered
        + Fix: don't permit a command with a motion component to wrap due
          to wrapscan and return to the original cursor position
        + Fix: ^E wasn't beeping when reaching the bottom of the file
        + Fix bg/fg bug where tmp file exiting caused a NULL dereference
        + Rework file locking code to use fcntl(2) explicitly
        + Fix bug in section code where invalid macros could be matched
        + Fix bug where line number reset by vi's Q command
        + Add explicit character mode designation to character mode buffers
        + Add <sys/ioctl.h> include to sex/sex_window.c, needed by NET/2
          vintage systems
        + Change to always flush a character during suspend, 4BSD curses
          has the optimization where it doesn't flush after a standend()
        + Fix bug on OSF1 where <curses.h> changes the values of VERASE,
          VKILL and VWERASE to incorrect ones
        + Fix bug where optarg used incorrectly in main.c
        + Block all signals when acting on a signal delivery
        + Fix recovery bug where RCV_EMAIL could fire even if there wasn't

Nvi 1.24 -> Nvi 1.25: Sun Jul 17 14:33:38 1994
        + Stop allowing keyboard suspends (^Z) in insert mode, it's hard
          to get autowrite correct, and it's not historic practice
        + Fix z^, z+ to match historic practice
        + Bug in message handling, "vi +35 non-existent_file" lost the
          status message because the "+35" pushed onto the stack erased
          it. For now, change so that messages aren't displayed if there
          are keys waiting - may need to add a "don't-erase" bit to the
          character in the stack instead
        + Bug in svi_msgflush(), where error messages could come out in
          normal video

Nvi 1.23 -> Nvi 1.24: Sat Jul 16 18:30:18 1994
        + Fix core dump in exf.c, where editing a non-existent file and
          exiting could cause already free'd memory to be free'd
        + Clean up numerous memory errors, courtesy of Purify
        + Change process wait code to fail if wait fails, and not attempt
          to interpret the wait return information
        + Open recovery and DB files for writing as well as reading, System
          V (fcntl) won't let you acquire LOCK_EX locks otherwise
        + Fix substitute bug where could malloc 0 bytes (AIX breaks)
        + Permit the mapping of <carriage-return>, it's historic practice
        + Historic vi didn't eat <blank> characters before the force
          flag, match historic practice
        + Bug in ex argument parsing, corrected for literal characters
          twice
        + Delete screen specific maps when the screen closes
        + Move to the first non-<blank> in the line on startup; historic
          practice
        + Change the ex visual command to move directly to a line if no
          trailing 'z' command
        + Fix "[[" and "]]" to match historic practice (yet again...)
        + Fix "yb" and "y{" commands to update the cursor correctly
        + Change "~<motion>" to match the yank cursor movement semantics
          exactly
        + Move all of the curses related code into sex/svi - major rework,
          but should help in future ports
        + Fix bug in split code caused by new file naming code, where would
          drop core when a split screen exited
        + Change svi_ex_write to do character display translation, so that
          messages with file names in them are displayed correctly
        + Display the file name on split screens instead of a divider line
        + Fix move bug, wasn't copying lines before putting them
        + Fix bug were :n dropped core if no arguments supplied
        + Don't quote characters in executed buffer: "ifoo<esc>" should
          leave insert mode after the buffer is executed
        + Tagpop and tagpush should set the absolute mark in case only
          moving within a file
        + Skip leading whitespace characters before tags and cursor word
          searches
        + Fix bug in ex_global where re_conv() was allocating the temporary
          buffer and not freeing it

Nvi 1.22 -> Nvi 1.23: Wed Jun 29 19:22:33 1994
        + New <sys/cdefs.h> required "inline" to change to "__inline"
        + Fix System V curses code for new ^Z support
        + Fix off-by-one in the move code, avoid ":1,$mo$" with only one
          line in the buffer
        + Line orientation of motion commands was remembered too long,
          i.e. '.' command could be incorrectly marked as line oriented
        + Move file modification time into EXF, so it's shared across
          split screens
        + Put the prev[ious] command back in, people complained
        + Random fixes to next/prev semantics changed in 1.22
        + Historically vi doesn't only move to the last address if there's
          ANYTHING after the addresses, e.g. ":3" moves to line 3, ":3|"
          prints line 3

Nvi 1.21 -> Nvi 1.22: Mon Jun 27 11:01:41 1994
        + Make the line between split screens inverse video again
        + Delete the prev[ious] command, it's not useful enough to keep
        + Rework :args/file name handling from scratch - MAJOR CHANGE,
          likely to introduce all sorts of new bugs
        + Fix RE bug where no sub-expressions in the pattern but there were
          sub-expressions referenced in the replacement, e.g. "s/XXX/\1/g"
        + Change recovery to not leave unmodified files around after a
          crash, by using the owner 'x' bit on unmodified backup files
          MAJOR CHANGE, the system recovery script has to change!
        + Change -r option to delete recovery.* files that reference non-
          existent vi.* files
        + Rework recovery locking so that fcntl(2) locking will work
        + Fix append (upper-case) buffers, broken by cut fixes
        + Fix | to not set the absolute motion mark
        + Read $HOME/.exrc file on startup if the effective user ID is
          root. This makes running vi while su(1)'d work correctly
        + Use the full pathname of the file as the recovery name, not
          just the last component. Matches historic practice
        + Keep marks in empty files from being destroyed
        + Block all caught signals before calling the DB routines
        + Make the line change report match historic practice (yanked
          lines were different than everything else)
        + Add section on multiple screens to the reference manual
        + Display all messages at once, combine onto a single line if
          possible. Delete the trailing period from all messages

Nvi: 1.20 -> Nvi 1.21: Thu May 19 12:21:58 1994
        + Delete the -l flag from the recover mail
        + Send the user email if ex command :preserve executed, this matches
          historic practice. Lots of changes to the preserve and recovery
          code, change preserve to snapshot files (again, historic practice)
        + Make buffers match historic practice: "add logically stores text
          into buffer a, buffer 1, and the unnamed buffer
        + Print <tab> characters as ^I on the colon command line if the
          list option set
        + Adjust ^F and ^B scroll values in the presence of split screens
          and small windows
        + Break msg* routines out from util.c into msg.c, start thinking
          about message catalogs
        + Add tildeop set option, based on STEVIE's option of the same name
          Changes the ~ command into "[count] ~ motion", i.e. ~ takes a
          trailing motion
        + Chose NOT to match historic practice on cursor positioning after
          consecutive undo commands on a single line; see vi/v_undo.c for
          the comment
        + Add a one line cache so that multiple changes to the same line
          are only counted once (e.g. "dl35p" changes one line, not 35)
        + Rework signals some more. Block file sync signals in vi routines
          that interface to DB, so can sync the files at interrupt time
          Write up all of the signal handling arguments, see signal.c

Nvi: 1.19 -> Nvi 1.20: Thu May 5 19:24:57 1994
        + Return ^Z to synchronous handling. See the discussion in signal.c
          and svi_screen.c:svi_curses_init()
        + Fix bug where line change report was wrong in util.c:msg_rpt()

Nvi: 1.18 -> Nvi 1.19: Thu May 5 12:59:51 1994
        + Block DSUSP so that ^Y isn't delivered at SIGTSTP
        + Fix bug - put into an empty file leaves the cursor at 1,0,
          not the first nonblank
        + Fix bug were number of lines reported for the 'P' command was
          off-by-one
        + Fix bug were 0^D wasn't being handled correctly
        + Delete remnants of ^Z as a raw character
        + Fix bug where if a map was an entire colon command, it may never
          have been displayed
        + Final cursor position fixes for the vi T and t commands
        + The ex :next command took an optional ex command as it's first
          argument similar to the :edit commands to match historic practice

Nvi 1.17 -> Nvi 1.18: Wed May 4 13:57:10 1994
        + Rework curses information in the PORT/Makefile's
        + Minor fixes to ^Z asynchronous code

Nvi 1.16 -> Nvi 1.17: Wed May 4 11:15:56 1994
        + Make ex comment handling match historic practice
        + Make ^Z work asynchronously, we can no longer use the SIGTSTP
          handler in the curses library

Nvi 1.15 -> Nvi 1.16: Mon May 2 19:42:07 1994
        + Make the 'p' and 'P' commands support counts, i.e. "Y10p" works
        + Make characters that map to themselves as the first part of the
          mapping work, it's historic practice
        + Fix bug where "s/./\& /" discarded the space in the replacement
          string
        + Add support for up/down cursor arrows in text input mode, rework
          left/right support to match industry practice
        + Fix bug were enough character remapping could corrupt memory
        + Delete O_REMAPMAX in favor of setting interrupts after N mapped
          characters without a read, delete the map counter per character
          MAJOR CHANGE. All of the interrupt signal handling has been
          reworked so that interrupts are always turned on instead of
          being turned on periodically, when an interruptible operation is
          pending
        + Fix bug where vi wait() was interrupted by the recovery alarm
        + Make +cmd's and initial commands execute with the current line
          set to the last line of the file. This is historic practice
        + Change "lock failed" error message to a file status message
          It always fails over NFS, and making all NFS files read-only
          isn't going to fly
        + Use the historic line number format, but check for overflow
        + Fix bug where vi command parser ignored buffers specified as
          part of the motion command
        + Make [@*]buffer commands on character mode buffers match historic
          practice
        + Fix bug where the cmap/chf entries of the tty structure weren't
          being cleared when new characters were read
        + Fix bug where the default command motion flags were being set
          when the command was a motion component
        + Fix wrapmargin bug; if appending characters, and wrapmargin breaks
          the line, an additional space is eaten

Nvi 1.14 -> Nvi 1.15: Fri Apr 29 07:44:57 1994
        + Make the ex delete command work in any empty file
        + Fix bug where 't' command placed the cursor on the character
          instead of to its left
        + ^D and ^U didn't set the scroll option value historically
          Note, this change means that any user set value (e.g. 15^D)
          will be lost when splitting the screen, since the split code
          now resets the scroll value regardless
        + Fix the ( command to set the absolute movement mark
        + Only use TIOCGWINSZ for window information if SIGWINCH signal
          caught
        + Delete the -l flag, and make -r work for multiple arguments
        + Add the ex "recover[!] file" command
        + Switch into ex terminal mode and use the sex routines when
          append/change/insert called from vi mode
        + Make ^F and ^B match historic practice. This required a fairly
          extensive rework of the svi scrolling code
        + Cursor positioning in H, M, L, G (first non-blank for 1G) wasn't
          being done correctly. Delete the SETLFNB flag. H, M, and L stay
          logical movements (SETNNB) and G always moves to the first non-
          blank
        + System V uses "lines" and "cols", not "li" and "co", change as
          necessary. Check termcap function returns for errors
        + Fix `<character> command to do start/end of line correction,
          and to set line mode if starting and stopping at column 0
        + Fix bug in delete code where dropped core if deleted in character
          mode to an empty line. (Rework the delete code for efficiency.)
        + Give up on SunOS 4.1.X, and use "cc" instead of /usr/5bin/cc
        + Protect ex_getline routine from interrupted system calls (if
          possible, set SA_RESTART on SIGALRM, too)
        + Fix leftright scrolling bug, when moving to a shorter line
        + Do validity checking on the copy, move, t command target line
          numbers
        + Change for System V % pattern broke trailing flags for empty
          replacement strings
        + Fix bug when RCM flags retained in the saved dot structure
        + Make the ex '=' command work for empty files
        + Fix bug where special_key array was being free'd (it's no longer
          allocated)
        + Matches cut in line mode only if the starting cursor is at or
          before the first non-blank in its line, and the ending cursor is
          at or after the last non-blank in its line
        + Add the :wn command, so you can write a file and switch to a new
          file in one command
        + Allow only a single key as an argument to :viusage
        + New movement code broke filter/paragraph operations in empty
          files ("!}date" in an empty file was dropping core)

Nvi 1.12 -> Nvi 1.14: Mon Apr 18 11:05:10 1994
        + Fix FILE structure leakage in the ex filter code
        + Rework suspend code for System V curses. Nvi has to do the
          the work, there's no way to get curses to do it right
        + Revert SunOS 4.1.X ports to the distributed curses. There's
          a bug in Sun's implementation that we can't live with
        + Quit immediately if row/column values are unreasonable
        + Fix the function keys to match vi historic behavior
        + Replace the echo/awk magic in the Makefile's with awk scripts
        + Version for 4.4BSD

Nvi 1.11 -> Nvi 1.12: Thu Apr 14 11:10:19 1994
        + Fix bug where only the first vi key was checked for validity
        + Make 'R' continue to overwrite after a <carriage-return>
        + Only display the "no recovery" message once
        + Rework line backup code to restore the line to its previous
          condition
        + Don't permit :q in a .exrc file or EXINIT variable
        + Fix wrapscan option bug where forward searches become backward
          searches and do cursor correction accordingly
        + Change "dd" to move the cursor to the first non-blank on the line
        + Delete cursor attraction to the first non-blank, change non-blank
          motions to set the most attractive cursor position instead
        + Fix 'r' substitute option to set the RE to the last RE, not the
          last substitute RE
        + Fix 'c' and 'g' substitute options to always toggle, and fix
          edcompatible option to not reset them
        + Display ex error messages in inverse video
        + Fix errorbells option to match historic practice
        + Delete fixed character display table in favor of table built based
          on the current locale
        + Add ":set octal" option, that displays unknown characters as octal
          values instead of the default hexadecimal
        + Make all command and text input modes interruptible
        + Fix ex input mode to display error messages immediately, instead
          of waiting for the lines to be resolved
        + Fix bug where vi calling append could overwrite the command
        + Fix off-by-one in the ex print routine tab code
        + Fix incorrect ^D test in vi text input routines
        + Add autoindent support for ex text insert routines
        + Add System V substitute command replacement pattern semantics,
          where '%' means the last replacement pattern
        + Fix bug that \ didn't escape newlines in ex commands
        + Regularize the names of special characters to CH_*
        + Change hex insert character from ^Vx<hex_char> to ^X<hex_char>
        + Integrate System V style curses, so SunOS and Solaris ports can
          use the native curses implementation

Nvi 1.10 -> Nvi 1.11: Thu Mar 24 16:07:45 EST 1994
        + Change H, M, and L to set the absolute mark, historical practice
        + Fix bug in stepping through multiple tags files
        + Add "remapmax" option that turns off map counts so you can remap
          infinitely. If it's off, term_key() can be interrupted from the
          keyboard, which will cause the buffers to flush. I also dropped
          the default max number of remaps to 50. (Only Dave Hitz's TM
          macros and maze appear to go over that limit.)
        + Change :mkexrc to not dump w{300,1200,9600}, lisp options
        + Fix backward search within a line bug
        + Change all the includes of "pathnames.h" to use <>'s so that the
          PORT versions can use -I. to replace it with their own versions
        + Make reads and writes interruptible. Rework code that enters and
          leaves ex for '!' and filter commands, rework all interrupt and
          timer code
        + Fix core dump when user displayed option in .exrc file
        + Fix bug where writing empty files didn't update the saved
          modification time
        + Fix bug where /pattern/ addressing was always a backward search
        + Fix bug triggered by autoindent of more than 32 characters, where
          nvi wasn't checking the right TEXT length
        + Fix bug where joining only empty lines caused a core dump

Nvi 1.09 -> Nvi 1.10: Sat Mar 19 15:40:29 EST 1994
        + Fix "set all" core dump

Nvi 1.08 -> Nvi 1.09: Sat Mar 19 10:11:14 EST 1994
        + If the tag's file path is relative, and it doesn't exist, check
          relative to the tag file location
        + Fix ~ command to free temporary buffer on error return
        + Create vi.ref, a first cut at a reference document for vi
          The manual page and the reference document only document the
          set options, so far
        + Fix 1G bug not always going to the first non-blank
        + Upgrade PORT/regex to release alpha3.4, from Henry Spencer
        + Add MKS vi's "cdpath" option, supporting a cd search path
        + Handle if search as a motion was discarded, i.e. "d/<erase>"
        + Change nvi to not create multiple recovery files if modifying
          a recovered file
        + Decide to ignore that the cursor is before the '$' when inserting
          in list mode. It's too hard to fix

Nvi 1.07 -> Nvi 1.08: Wed Mar 16 07:37:36 EST 1994
        + Leftright and big line scrolling fixes. This meant more changes
          to the screen display code, so there may be new problems
        + Don't permit search-style addresses until a file has been read
        + "c[Ww]" command incorrectly handled the "in whitespace" case
        + Fix key space allocation bug triggered by cut/paste under SunOS
        + Ex move command got the final cursor position wrong
        + Delete "optimize option not implemented" message
        + Make the literal-next character turn off mapping for the next
          character in text input mode

Nvi 1.06 -> Nvi 1.07: Mon Mar 14 11:10:33 EST 1994
        + The "wire down" change in 1.05 broke ex command parsing, there
          wasn't a corresponding change to handle multiple K_VLNEXT chars
        + Fix final position for vi's 't' command

Nvi 1.05 -> Nvi 1.06: Sun Mar 13 16:12:52 EST 1994
        + Wire down ^D, ^H, ^W, and ^V, regardless of the user's termios
          values
        + Add ^D as the ex scroll command
        + Support ^Q as a literal-next character
        + Rework abbreviations to be delimited by any !inword() character
        + Add options description to the manual page
        + Minor screen cache fix for svi_get.c
        + Rework beautify option support to match historical practice
        + Exit immediately if not reading from a tty and a command fails
        + Default the SunOS 4.* ports to the distributed curses, not SMI's

Nvi 1.04 -> Nvi 1.05: Thu Mar 24 16:07:45 EST 1994
        + Make cursor keys work in input mode
        + Rework screen column code in vi curses screen. MAJOR CHANGE -
          after this, we'll be debugging curses screen presentation from
          scratch
        + Explode include files in vi.h into the source files

Nvi 1.03 -> Nvi 1.04: Sun Mar 6 14:14:16 EST 1994
        + Make the ex move command keep the marks on the moved lines
        + Change resize semantics so you can set the screen size to a
          specific value. A couple of screen fixes for the resize code
        + Fixes for foreground/background due to SIGWINCH
        + Complete rework of all of vi's cursor movements. The underlying
          assumption in the old code was that the starting cursor position
          was part of the range of lines cut or deleted. The command
          "d[[" is an example where this isn't true. Change it so that all
          motion component commands set the final cursor position separately
          from the range, as it can't be done correctly later. This is a
          MAJOR CHANGE - after this change, we'll be debugging the cursor
          positioning from scratch
        + Rewrite the B, b, E, e commands to use vi's getc() interface
          instead of rolling their own
        + Add a second MARK structure, LMARK, which is the larger mark
          needed by the logging and mark queue code. Everything else uses
          the reworked MARK structure, which is simply a line/column pair
        + Rework cut/delete to not expect 1-past-the-end in the range, but
          to act on text to the end of the range, inclusive
        + Sync on write's, to force NFS to flush

Nvi 1.01 -> Nvi 1.03: Sun Jan 23 17:50:35 EST 1994
        + Tag stack fixes, was returning to the tag, not the position from
          which the user tagged
        + Only use from the cursor to the end of the word in cursor word
          searches and tags. (Matches historical vi behavior.)
        + Fix delete-last-line bug when line number option set
        + Fix usage line for :split command
        + If O_NUMBER set, long input lines would eventually fail, the
          column count for the second screen of long lines wasn't set
          correctly
        + Fix for [[ reaching SOF with a column longer than the first line
        + Fix for multiple error messages if no screen displayed
        + Fix :read to set alternate file name as in historical practice
        + Fix cut to rotate the numeric buffers if line mode flag set

Nvi 1.00 -> Nvi 1.01: Wed Jan 12 13:37:18 EST 1994
        + Don't put cut items into numeric buffers if cutting less than
          parts of two lines

Nvi 0.94 -> Nvi 1.00: Mon Jan 10 02:27:27 EST 1994
        + Read-ahead not there; BSD tty driver problem, SunOS curses
          problem
        + Global command could error if it deleted the last line of
          the file
        + Change '.' to only apply to the 'u' if entered immediately
          after the 'u' command. "1pu.u.u. is still broken, but I
          expect that it's going to be sacrificed for multiple undo
        + If backward motion on a command, now move to the point; get
          yank cursor positioning correct
        + Rework cut buffers to match historic practice - yank/delete
          numeric buffers redone sensibly, ignoring historic practice

Nvi 0.92 -> Nvi 0.93: Mon Dec 20 19:52:14 EST 1993
        + Christos Zoulas reimplemented the script windows using pty's,
          which means that they now work reasonably. The down side of
          this is that almost all ports other than 4.4BSD need to include
          two new files, login_tty.c and pty.c from the PORT/clib directory
          I've added them to the Makefiles
        + All calloc/malloc/realloc functions now cast their pointers, for
          SunOS - there should be far fewer warning messages, during the
          build. The remaining messages are where CHAR_T's meet char *'s,
          i.e. where 8-bit clean meets strcmp
        + The user's argument list handling has been reworked so that there
          is always a single consistent position for use by :next, :prev and
          :rewind
        + All of the historical options are now at least accepted, although
          not all of them are implemented. (Edcompatible, hardtabs, lisp,
          optimize, redraw, and slowopen aren't implemented.)
        + The RE's have been reworked so that matches of length 0 are
          handled in the same way as vi used to handle them
        + Several more mapping fixes and ex parser addressing fixes
